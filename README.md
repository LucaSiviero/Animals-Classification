# Animals-Classification
This is a repo for the Advanced OS project.
The goal of the exam is to study and understand how distributed systems work on large dataset with the Map Reduce paradigm. In addition, studies and information on how distributed systems can take advantage of Distributed File Systems like HDFS and Google File System were required to pass the exam.
A cluster of 8 machines with a pre-configured version of Spark, Apache Hadoop and HDFS was provided. 
The project's focus is to implement an application that uses Map Reduce to work on large dataset. A 9 GB dataset was uploaded via the HDFS.
It's an image-based dataset that contains 80 different classes of animals pictures.
The final goal was to implement, on Spark with Elephas, Tensorflow and Python a fully working Convolutional Neural Network model that could be trained on the training dataset and be able to predict the class of the animal that was displayed in the pictures in the test dataset.
